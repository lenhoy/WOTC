# Python Plotting Scripts Documentation

This directory contains Python scripts for visualizing simulation data. Most scripts expect data in the `_py.mat` format generated by the MATLAB conversion script.

## General Utilities

* **`inspect_keys.py`**: A utility to quickly inspect the contents of a `.mat` file. It prints presence of keys and summary statistics (min/max) for speed signals to help verify data integrity.
* **`plot_selection.py`**: A purely generic, interactive plotter. It scans the data file for *all* available time-series signals and lets you select which ones to plot via a checklist. Includes a control window for renaming series and toggling visibility.

## Single Run Plots

* **`plot_heading.py`**: Plots the vessel's actual Heading ($\psi$) against the Desired Heading ($\psi_d$) over time. Includes usage of a configuration dialog to customize title and labels.
* **`plot_speed.py`**: Plots the vessel's Total Speed ($U$) against the Desired Speed ($U_d$) over time for a single simulation run.
* **`plot_trajectory_WO.py`**: Plots the vessel's North-East trajectory for WO operations. It includes additional markers for the reference path (`etad`) and `p0` to visualize tracking performance.
* **`plot_trajectory_WO_triangles.py`**: A variation of the WO trajectory plot. Instead of dots, it uses triangles to represent the reference path (`etad`), allowing you to visualize the desired heading along the path.
* **`plot_trajectory_varying_current.py`**: Plots the vessel trajectory superimposed with current vectors to visualize environmental forces. Features an interactive control panel (sliders) to adjust arrow size, density, and scaling in real-time.
* **`plot_trajectory_varying_current_alt2.py`**: An alternative version of the varying current trajectory plotter, maintained as a backup or variation.

## Comparison Plots

* **`plot_speed_comparison.py`**: Compares Speed ($U$) and Desired Speed ($U_d$) across multiple simulation runs. You can select any number of data files to overlay on the same plot, with options to rename legends and toggle series visibility.
* **`plot_tau_comparison.py`**: Compares the total thrust force (`tau_thr_sum`) across multiple simulation runs. Useful for analyzing and comparing control effort or energy usage between different controller tunings or scenarios.
